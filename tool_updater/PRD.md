## What does the tool do?
i want to build an agentic application using langraph, langchain. My use case is that i have several tools installed on my linux machine like nodejs, several cli tools (azure cli, kubectl), binaries (e.g. anchore/syft). What i want is the agent to feed only the name of my tools i have installed and the agent should be able to get the latest information in how to install and how to update these tools, in the end it should produce one consice readme.md file for me. Conceptionally iwould build a ReAct agent which i feed a proper system prompt for the llm. The user input could be the list of tools or any other related requirement like "i want to install tool xxx" show me howto do. Furthmure i think the llm needs a tool to get the latest information about each tool? Question 1: is my approach valid in general? Question 2: if my approach is valid how do i provide an llm tool which could get install and update guides for my requested tools binaries, software, cli whatever.
