Please create the same functionallity as both files in the "barebones" directory do provide
- ingest_database.py is the RAG pipeline part which reads a directory and ingest the embeddings into a vector db
- chatbot.py is the chatbot which uses the vectordb data to enricht the chatbots prompt.

What i want is to follow the documentation of langchain in how to build an ai agent.
Please review this page https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/agents/

You should add your implementation in the agent directory. 
You can have the RAG ingest and the chatbot as 2 separate files which are startable separately.
